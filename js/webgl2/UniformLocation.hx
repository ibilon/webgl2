/**
UniformLocation represents the location of a uniform variable in a shader program.

The UniformLocation object does not define any methods or properties of its own and its content is not directly accessible.
When working with UniformLocation objects, the following methods of the `RenderingContext` are useful:

* `RenderingContext.getUniformLocation()`
* `RenderingContext.uniform()`
